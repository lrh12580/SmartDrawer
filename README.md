# SmartDrawer
This is a project that could help users cultivate good habits of organizing personal items. This project consists of three parts: hardware module (Arduino+ESP8266), server and Android client. All of the items in the drawer are tagged with RIFD. When items are taken out or new items are put into the drawer, the hardware will detect the change of items and send it to the server. The server will send notification to the client, and statistics of item change history will be visualized to make users form better habits of managing personal items.
